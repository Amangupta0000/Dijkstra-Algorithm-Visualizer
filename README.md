# Dijkstra's Algorithm Visualizer

I built this project as a way to help students learning about data structures and algorithms fully conceptualize how Dijkstra's Algorithm works. The app features a fully-functional graph designer tool and algorithm animation that displays the state of both the graph and priority queue after each step in the traversal.

If you're interested in how the code for the canvas works I have added documentation for all the related functions to make it easy to understand.
